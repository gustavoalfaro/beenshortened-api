# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
    ShortLink.create(slug: '3', redirect_link: 'https://www.facebook.com/', access_count: 3)
    ShortLink.create(slug: '4', redirect_link: 'https://www.instagram.com/', access_count: 2)
